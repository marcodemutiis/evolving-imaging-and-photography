# About

This site is a collection of courses and learning materials on topics related to evolving imaging and photography, created by Marco De Mutiis for HTWG Konstanz.

The term "evolving imaging and photography" represents a continuous journey of creative exploration, where technological innovations and artistic experimentation merge to push the boundaries of visual culture. This evolution is not about replacing traditional methods but expanding the ways we see, capture, interpret, and share the world around us—experimenting with new possibilities while remaining connected to the traditions of photographic expression.

This approach to photography is not to be understood as technical progress, but rather as a creative evolution. It encourages photographers, designers, and artists to critically and playfully engage with contemporary forms of networked and computational images — exploring photography as a medium in constant flux, experimentation, and development.
