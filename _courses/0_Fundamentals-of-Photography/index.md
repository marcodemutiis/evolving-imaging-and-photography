## About
This course explores the fundamentals of photography, tracing its development over the past 200 years to the present day. Rather than reducing photography to a single definition, it opens up the medium to a multiplicity of approaches — from architectural photography and photojournalism to social documentary, studio and product photography, conceptual art photography, and beyond. The course examines how these traditions continue to shape the way we create and read images today, and how photography has been transformed by digital and computational forms.
Combining historical overview with hands-on practice, the course introduces students to analogue and digital image-making. Technical concepts such as lighting, focus, framing, and composition are covered alongside the relational dynamics between photographers and their subjects. Students also develop skills in semiotic image analysis, with attention to how images function across different forms of publishing and circulation.

## Lernziele des Moduls:
Students will gain a broad understanding of the history and diversity of photographic practice. They will develop technical proficiency in both analogue and digital image-making, and will be able to critically analyse images using semiotic methods. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to situate their own photographic work within broader historical, cultural, and media contexts.

## Leistungsnachweis:
Students demonstrate their learning through a self-directed final project, choosing one of the following formats:
A. A photographic series of 5–10 prints
B. A photo book dummy (printed and as PDF)
C. A digital project (website, digital collage, or interactive documentary)
