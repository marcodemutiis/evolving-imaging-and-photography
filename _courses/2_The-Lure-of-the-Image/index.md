![The Lure of the Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses/2_The-Lure-of-the-Image/assets/img/AIASMR2.jpg)

Why and how are we seduced by images today? What logic underpins this seduction and how does it influence current social, cultural and political developments?

The course investigates the visual worlds of contemporary photography on social media feeds, dating app profiles, beauty filters, memes, ASMR videos, ‘cute’ and ‘cursed’ images, emojis, computer-generated imagery and low-resolution screenshots used for conspiracy or protest.
