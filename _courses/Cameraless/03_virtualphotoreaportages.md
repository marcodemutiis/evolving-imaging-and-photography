## Study Cases

### Marcio Cadioli, <em>Arenae</em>, 2005

<figcaption>Marcio Cadioli, from <em>Arenae</em>, 2005</figcaption>
<blockquote>"Arenae [...] is the title of Marco Cadioli’s photographic reportages from the virtual battlefields scattered across the net. Cadioli investigates the notion of simulated combat in online multiplayer games such as Counter-Strike, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, and Quake III: Arena. As the title itself suggests, Cadioli sees today’s ludic arenae as an extension of the traditional arena, where gladiators fought for their lives to entertain a blood-thirsty audience. Multiplayer first-person shooters allow thousands of players to engage in a violent game of cat-and-mouse. These virtual spaces have their own rules, conventions, and limitations: one must search and destroy, kill or be killed, fight or be finished, hide and seek. 

Cadioli joins the servers, but only to play a peculiar role. He shoots, but does not kill. His weapon is a (virtual) camera. Like a modern-day Robert Capa, the Milanese photographer gets knee-deep in the trenches to capture the intensity of the fights. Under the guidance of an expert player, Gnj, Cadioli takes pictures of the soldiers. [...] 

He is using a virtual zoom, specifically designed for the job. The resulting 35mm black and white digital photographs evoke the look-and-feel of the “real” war stock photos. The collusion between memory and media is striking. All images are staged and fabricated, Cadioli implicitly suggests, so there seems to be not a significant difference between the photographs of a “real” war and screenshots take during gameplay. Our notions of past, conflict, and violence are made up of images. Arenae exemplifies Cadioli’s fascination for what he calls “Internet Landscapes”, the vistas and panorama that modern day explorers encounter on the net. Cadioli’s goal is to document the transient, preserving these ephemeral moments form disappearing into oblivion. But the enclosed areas in which the fight takes place are also spaces of experimentation, interstitial zones between different planes of reality. Shooting avatars online becomes a pretext to socialize and interact."

### Roc Herms, <em>Postcards from Home</em>, 2016

<figcaption>Roc Herms, from <em>Postcards from Home</em>, 2016</figcaption>

<blockquote>“With Second Life and virtual reality platforms like PlayStation Home, the world has split in two. In it we have total freedom to invent our own personality and choose any lifestyle we want; on screen we can continue our everyday tedium or we can embark on intrepid adventures. We can decide which virtual urban tribes we want to subscribe to, and, logically, in this world of possibilities, we can become photographers and choose between creating reports in the style of Cartier-Bresson or Robert Frank, or styling portraits like Richard Avedon or Diane Arbus. These dilemmas are some that Barcelonan Roc Herms faces with his project “Postcards from Home”. In his virtual life, Herms is always there, camera at the ready, seeking out defining moments that celebrate diversity, in both thematic fixations and stylistic approaches.”

– Joan Fontcuberta, 2013 – quoted on<a href="https://www.rocherms.com/projects/postcards-from-home/?lang=en"><em>artist website</em></a></blockquote>
