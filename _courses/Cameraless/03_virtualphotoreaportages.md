<blockquote>“With Second Life and virtual reality platforms like PlayStation Home, the world has split in two. In it we have total freedom to invent our own personality and choose any lifestyle we want; on screen we can continue our everyday tedium or we can embark on intrepid adventures. We can decide which virtual urban tribes we want to subscribe to, and, logically, in this world of possibilities, we can become photographers and choose between creating reports in the style of Cartier-Bresson or Robert Frank, or styling portraits like Richard Avedon or Diane Arbus. These dilemmas are some that Barcelonan Roc Herms faces with his project “Postcards from Home”. In his virtual life, Herms is always there, camera at the ready, seeking out defining moments that celebrate diversity, in both thematic fixations and stylistic approaches.”

– Joan Fontcuberta, 2013 – quoted on<a href="https://www.rocherms.com/projects/postcards-from-home/?lang=en"><em>artist website</em></a></blockquote>
