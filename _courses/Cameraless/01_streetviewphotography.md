Screenshotting can be technically understood as a 1:1 copy of the computer screen. Yet it can also be seen as a photographic act, in a world that is increasingly rendered on the screen, mapped digitally in virtual maps. 

Among many online platforms that can be explored by photographers with out a camera, Google Street View has become one of the most popular destination for screenshotters. Drawing from different traditions such as street photography and photojournalism, many photographers and artists have explored Google Street View through screenshots, while bringing a photographic approach and mindset.


## Study Cases

"Nine Eyes of Google Street View is both an archival project and a conceptual meditation on the state of photography in a time of automated imagemaking on a massive scale.

In 2008, Jon Rafman began to collect screenshots of images from Google Street View. At the time, Street View was a relatively new initiative, an effort to document everything in the world that could be seen from a moving car. A massive, undiscerning machine for image-making whose purpose is to simply capture everything, Street View takes photographs without apparent concern for ethics or aesthetics, from a supposedly neutral point of view.

Rafman conducted a close reading of Google Street View and began to isolate images from this massive database, publishing them on blogs, as PDFs, in books, and as large C-prints for gallery exhibition. In so doing, he reframed them within longer histories of photography and painting, raising questions about the meaning and function of these images and their implications for artists and image-makers."

### Mario Santamaria, <em>Non-Imaginary Museum</em>, 2013–ongoing

"Mario Santamaría is part of a growing canon of screenshot photographers drawn to the uncanny crash of interface, database, camera and screen produced by the ‘nine eyes’ of the Google Street View camera. In contrast with other artists who have heroically pointed their mouse at the dazzling vastness of the Google Street View landscape, Santamaría has weaponised the screenshot to probe Google’s scopic regime and the sociotechnical infrastructure that sustains it. 

In 2013 the artist began a trilogy of works in response to Google Art Project, a cultural interface launched in 2011 hosting virtual tours of over 2,000 leading museums and their collections. A spectacular feat of engineering and cultural diplomacy, Google Art Project functions as a photographic apparatus which
depends on Google Street View technology and custom Gigapixel cameras to produce an immersive space for consuming art. In <em>Trolling Google Art
Project</em> (2013–ongoing) Mario Santamaría mobilises the screenshot as an artistic strategy to break the transparency of Google’s interface and
expose its representational paradigm.

[...] <em>The Non-Imaginary Museum</em> (2013–ongoing), [...] presents artworks adorning the walls of the Google Art Project that have been obscured and rendered unintelligible by a Gaussian algorithm due to copyright restrictions. Probing the limits of Google’s reproductive paradigm, these screenshots appear
to undermine Google’s emphasis on universal access to public culture. Santamaría draws attention to the way different values are encoded into the interface, arguing 'these works are blurred because their time of economic exploitation continues, because they are commercialised in another place or another format'. The screenshot captures a moment where analogue models of value are encoded into a computational environment: echoed by the remediation of the photographic act in the gesture of the screen capture itself."
