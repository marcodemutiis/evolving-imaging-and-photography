A copy of an image can be understood as a photographic act that carries social and political meaning: to copy is to steal, but also to reclaim or reappropriate, and to critique representation through a simple gesture. What changes is not the content of the image, but its context.

In photography, a conceptual tradition of image appropriation emerged most prominently in the 1980s, when the act of rephotographing was used to challenge the power structures embedded in advertising images and in the art world. Contemporary practices such as digital scanning and screenshotting can be understood within this photographic lineage, extending the inquiry into internet phenomena as well as the technical biases and social issues embedded in the infrastructures of image circulation.

<blockquote>"In April 2001, I launched AfterWalkerEvans.com and AfterSherrieLevine.com, two identical websites on which I made freely available high-resolution scans of Walker Evans images rephotographed by Sherrie Levine. These digital images are accessible to anyone, andÂ while they accrue cultural value, they retain little to no economic value. The site links to high-resolution, exhibition-quality images and certificates of authenticity to be signed by the downloader, and includes framing and exhibition directions."

<blockquote>"Ed Ruscha’s photo books from the 1960s and 1970s all documented specific typologies of the Californian environment of that time. From gasoline stations to pools to parking lots, most publications analyse the American landscape through an austere use of photography, employed as an almost scientific tool. Often referred to as New Topographics, this school of photographic documentation featured formal, black and white images of the urban landscape. Luke Caspar Pearson was inspired by Ed Ruscha’s artist books to screenshot the game world of GTA V, attempting to reproduce the photographer’s subjects and style. Pearson’s game images are collected and published in little books that are direct reproductions of Ruscha’s original publications, namely Twentysix Gasoline Stations, Thirtyfour Parking Lots in Los Angeles and Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass.

While other artists have re-enacted the photographic series of Ed Ruscha in GTA V, Pearson does not stop at the copy and playing with the blurry boundaries between photographic documentation and photorealistic simulation. The artist extends the work of Ruscha by imagining two new possible series within the game: Cars on Hills and Many Mission Markers. Here Pearson attempts to employ the same 'deadpan' photographic style to elements that are specific to GTA V and exist within a virtual world, and which would be improbable or impossible outside of the video game screen. Through this approach, the Little Books of Los Santos show the development of a photographic practice in relation to the game object, moving from the replica of the analogue medium to an approach and a mindset that investigates the specificities of the virtual world through image-making."

<blockquote>On her profile @insta_repeat, Emma Agnes Sheffer posts "a collage of virtually identical motifs that the US American artist found on the profiles of different influencers.

Sheffer uses this juxtaposition to show how users with large numbers of followers define how a ‘successful’ image should look like: the more likes, clicks and shares a picture gets, the more influence it has on visual idioms. This pictorial language is imitated by other users around the world and thus becomes an unwritten aesthetic rule, which ends up in a process of standardisation. In playing the ‘attention’ game, it is not originality that counts so much as how well it can be staked out and marketed."
