The camera has come to be understood as the quintessential tool of the photographer for more than 200 years. And yet, contemporary photographic images seem to be increasingly created through cameraless processes: from screenshotting to photorealistic CGI, from generative AI to simulated cameras and photo modes in virtual worlds. 

This course explores the transformation of the camera apparatus in digital and software forms, and offers insights in alternative ways of image-making for photographers, designers and artists.
